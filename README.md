# BrewCrew

The project entitled BrewCrew is a C# based application for a bubble tea café. Bubble tea is 	Taiwanese tea-based drink with flavors of milk and sugar, and jelly-based toppings usually called 	“pearls”. The application would allow potential users to sign in/ sign up with the BrewCrew 	application, browse through the café menu and build an order which could be picked up from 	the tea shop using a confirmation QR code generated by the application on order completion. 

BrewCrew is being developed to work as a virtual kiosk for the customers to cut through 	huge line ups and waiting times during rush hours at a café. The users of the application 	would 	be able to order customized drinks by filtering and selecting through the bubble 	tea flavors and 	toppings option. The admin of the application would have the privilege to edit the bubble tea 	menu and browse through all the orders given by customers
